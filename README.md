String comparison:

  * Levenshtein Distance
  * Damerau-Levenshtein Distance
  * Jaro Distance
  * Jaro-Winkler Distance
  * Hamming Distance
  * Longest Substring

Example Usage
-------------

    ruby-1.9.2-p0 > require 'rubyfish'
    ruby-1.9.2-p0 > RubyFish::Levenshtein.distance("jellyfish", "rubyfish")
    => 4
    ruby-1.9.2-p0 > RubyFish::Jaro.distance("jellyfish", "rubyfish")
    => 0.7268518518518519
    ruby-1.9.2-p0 > RubyFish::DamerauLevenshtein.distance("rubyfish", "rubyfihs")
    => 1
    
    ruby-1.9.2-p0 > RubyFish::DoubleMetaphone.phonetic_code "prived"
     => ["PRFT", nil] 
    ruby-1.9.2-p0 > RubyFish::DoubleMetaphone.phonetic_code "privet"
     => ["PRFT", nil]
